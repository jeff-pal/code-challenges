# CEFIS Learning

## suggestion

1. We could have a route returning only the id, title and banner of the courses available. Then, from the selected course, we could obtain more details through the id in another route, avoiding the loading of perhaps unnecessary data.

2. We could also use [LinkHeader](https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkHeader) to paginate and return course content on demand.
